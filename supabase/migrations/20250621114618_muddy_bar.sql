  # Fix Customer RLS Policies and Permissions

  1. Clean Up
    - Drop all existing policies to start fresh
    - Reset permissions

  2. Grant Permissions
    - Grant necessary permissions to anon and authenticated roles
    - Ensure sequence permissions are granted

  3. RLS Policies
    - Create comprehensive policies for both anon and authenticated users
    - Allow all operations on default company customers

  4. Verification
    - Test the policies work correctly
